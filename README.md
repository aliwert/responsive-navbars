## NAVBARS
- The two files have two different navbars, you can choose and use according to your taste. Since the navbar issue can be quite challenging in some projects, I wanted to share it with you. Have a good work!
- If you want to use it in React, you can adapt the HTML code to React by using the `html to jsx` website. Just paste the HTML code there and it will convert it accordingly to React.
